# About Project
This little project was originally created for the "C Programming" course, but I adapted the logic to the JS language.

# CSS
To writing the styles I have used the BEM conventions in addition to Normalize for better cross-browser consistency. 

# JS
I have created the script with all the basic logic excuding the betting system. I have also inclued the library SweetAlerts.
